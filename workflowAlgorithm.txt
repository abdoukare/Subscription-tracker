WorkFlow algorithm

1. Triggering the workflow -> the workflow begins whenever a user create a new subscription . We pass the created subscription ID to our Workflow
@. Retreiving subscription Details
    . The proccess extracts the subscription ID from the context
    . it then searches for the corresponding subscription in the database
3. Validation cheks
    . If the subscription does not exist, an error is logged , and the preocess terminates
    . if the subscription exists, it status is cheked:
        . if inactive, the status is logged, and the process exits.
        . if active , the renewal date is verifed.
4. Renewal date evaluation
    . if the renewal date has passed, it logs this information and exits
    . if the renewal date is in the future, the reminder loop begins
5. Reminder Scheduling
    .For each predefined reminder:
        . the reminder date is calculated
        . if the reminder date is in the future, the system waits unitl that time.
        . Once the reminder date arrives (or if it hase already pased,) the reminder email is sent
6. completion
    The process repeates for all reminders in the list
    after processing all reminders , the workflow concludes .
